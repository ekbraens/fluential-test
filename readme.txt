did not finish the challenge!

ran out of time

had a few confusions at the beginning and slowed me down

once i got into the meat of the challenge, i stumbled getting the strings out of the nsdictionary i had set up to handle all of the sets of words

i would like to believe if i had more time i would have figured it out

a real shame, Iâ€™m a bit embarrassed.
